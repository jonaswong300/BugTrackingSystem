Step to reproduce:
Download a file that will take some time to complete
Download four more files
Click the Downloads â‡© button on the toolbar


Actual results:
The bottom item in the list should show the total size and estimated ETA of active downloads past the first five that are shown in the drop-down list.


Expected results:
The bottom item shows the correct ETA of active downloads, but a wildly inaccurate total size.
