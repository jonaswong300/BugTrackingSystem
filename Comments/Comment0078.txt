Comment : What I did now:
Start Firefox
Start capturing
Open about:logins
Stop capturing
As you can see, it took 5 seconds to show the logins.

Comment : Thanks Thomas. Apologies, but it looks like the thread that decryption runs in (StreamTrans) is not enabled by default for any of the profiler presets. Would you mind recording one more time with that thread enabled?

Comment : In the presets dropdown for the Profiler popup, select Custom
Click Edit Settings
Under Profiler Settings, select the Firefox Front-End preset
Under Threads, enable StreamTrans

Comment : It is rather alarming that it looks like decryptMany is taking around 4000ms for 750 logins, which would mean an average of around 5ms to decrypt each login... which is orders of magnitude longer than I would expect. Thomas, is there any chance that one of these logins is very long? Were these logins imported from another profile? A quick way of getting an idea of this would be to export the logins to a file from the ... menu in about:logins, and see how big the file is. For reference, I have 210 logins in my profile, and the file is 40KB.

Comment : Bug 1592682 will handle the headings for date/alert sorts but this bug will need to use the ICU API to do section headings for a-z/z-a sorts.,

Comment : Ryan – Could provide dark-mode specs as well? Some of these don't have a dark mode counter part. Changing what I can beyond that!,

Comment : In the past, I believe dark mode handling has largely been supported somewhat automagically based on how the light-mode colors are set, rather than setting specific dark-mode specs. Jaws, please correct me if I'm wrong.,
