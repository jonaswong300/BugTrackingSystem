Comment : Do you use Primary Password (formerly Master Password)? I ask, because that can further slow down decryption of logins.

Comment : Is it possible to run some profiling within Firefox, e.g. how long the decryption takes vs. other functionality when the logins are opened?

Comment : Yes it is. Would you be comfortable capturing a profile of the about:logins page load in the slow case? There are some instructions for how to report a performance problem on MDN.
