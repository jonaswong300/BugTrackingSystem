Comment : Sounds like an edge case, I don't think this is a priority to fix in 70. Let me know if you disagree once this is triaged by the team though.,

Comment : This is quite an edge case since the user has to sign in to Firefox using the button in the browser toolbar. Any action on the page such as creating, deleting, opening a site, or clicking the Accounts button within the page will cause the future synced logins to load properly. I'll change this to 70-wontfix.,

Comment : In the event that the strings in aboutLogins.ftl are used in a different context, we should proactively add the "about-logins-" prefix to the string names. As part of this work, a migration script should be created so localizers will not have to retranslate all of the strings.,

Comment : There's a risk here:
about:logins was exposed in 70
if we land this in 71, we'll have to carry around both strings (prefixed and non) for a few cycles because of cross-channel. And locales who didn't translate before we run the migration will have to translate them twice.
A solution would be to do this and make sure we uplift to beta if it doesn't land before next Monday.,
