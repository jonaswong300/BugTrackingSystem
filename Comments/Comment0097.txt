Comment : There are no current plans to implement this. We would need to think through the requirements and user experience quite carefully.

Comment : For example,
What happens if the about:logins tab is closed, would we expect the timeout to still fire and clear the clipboard when the timer expires?
Should we show a notification when the clipboard is cleared? Perhaps only if it is cleared as a result of timing out, not when used.
The paste that uses the copied password could be in any window. Would we need to observe all pastes across all windows until the timer expired to know when to clear the clipboard?
If you want to explore this I would be happy to work with you on a prototype patch, but I think we would need a lot more clarity before we could ship this feature.,
