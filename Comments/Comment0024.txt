Comment : Please don't remove this as the OS authentication feature doesn't add any meaningful amount of security. 
It prevents you from extracting the password from about:logins, but you can still extract the password by going to the site, auto-filling the 
password, and read it from the DOM (eg. document.querySelector("input[type=password]").value). 
Better yet, you can go to the profile folder and copy out logins.json and key4.db, which gets you all the passwords in 
unencrypted format. Maybe users want this feature for peace of mind, but I find it a hassle.,

Comment : In the local account it kept flipping defaults between PIN and password entry (no username entry, which is good):
