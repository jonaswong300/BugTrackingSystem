Comment : Hi, sure, I think you should base this patch on top of the patch in Bug 1613620 to avoid duplicating work around the new confirmation dialog template. You will be automatically assigned to this bug when you upload a patch. Thanks!

Comment : If a user has saved the same password on multiple sites, perhaps we can somehow flag this in the Password Manager interface.  Particularly if the same password is being used on an HTTP page and an HTTPS page.  Since the former can be read in cleartext, it exposes the later to compromise.,

Comment : Don't get too naggy about it though. I have 30-ish legitimate instances of my mozilla LDAP password. Even "same eTLD+1" heuristics will get the recommendation wrong because there's a mix of mozilla.ORG and .COM sites, as well as the completely different mozilla.okta.com and mozilla.service-now.com,
