Comment : Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, f**k you,

Comment : I'm still unsure of what you mean by "*". Do you mean as a value of a comment-tag? What does that value mean?,
