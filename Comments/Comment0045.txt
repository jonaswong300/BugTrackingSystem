Comment : Thank you for filing this bug. This might be caused by slower decryption on Windows, and the fact that we decrypt every login on page load currently.

Comment : Are you using portable Firefox or storing your Firefox profile on an external device (e.g. flash drive, network folder, ...)?

Comment : No, I'm using a normal (non-portable) installation of Firefox 79.0 on Windows 10 Enterprise (Version 1803), on a Dell Precision 7520 laptop (2.9 GHz i7 Processor) with a 512 GB SSD and 32 GB memory. The profile is stored on the SSD, no network folders or external devices are used. With an idle CPU it takes 5 seconds to show the logins when about:logins is used.

Comment : Bug 1535189 could not have regressed this. There was no change in that bug.,

Comment : My thinking is that here we should check if the scheme is about: and exempt from RFP then. This will affect a lot more than just the color scheme of about:logins, so it needs a bit of thought, but I don't think we should be allowing anything that could result in about: pages making people fingerprintable from the web so probably safe?,
