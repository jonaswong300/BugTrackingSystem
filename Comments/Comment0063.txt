Comment : If no logins are saved and a password master is set, when creating the first login the "Password Required" pop-up is displayed after clicking the "Save" button. If the "Cancel" button of the pop-up is clicked, a yellow banner warning is displayed on the top of the page that informs you that you need to enter your master password. If you press the "Log in" button from the banner, the "Create New Login" form is dismissed even if the fields are completed. From the QA point of view, the users might expect that the "Password Required" pop-up is redisplayed and the entered data is lost.,

I don't realize which bug may be caused this issue, but I observe that the issue was introduced when the Logins and Passwords form was changed (Firefox Lockwise was introduced).,
