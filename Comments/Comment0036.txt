Comment : Jared, did your recent related fix also fix this?,

Comment : No, my change wouldn't have fixed this since we only store what passwords are vulnerable per profile and don't sync that list. Once a password is marked as vulnerable it's only known to be vulnerable for that profile. Since the breached login has its password changed, when the logins are synced to the new profile the new profile won't know that the there are vulnerable logins.,
