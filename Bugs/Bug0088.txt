Title :  Unable to log into the network with HTTPS Everywhere
Keywords :  unable,login,network,https,everywhere,

Severity Level : 3
Solved status : closed (FLAGGED AS INVALID)
Bug :  User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0

Steps to reproduce:

I tried to log into a public network. It is done by intercepting HTTP requests and sending the login form instead.

Actual results:

I didn't succeed because of HTTPS Everywhere extension and its strict mode. It tried to redirect http://detectportal.firefox.com/success.txtto HTTPS, so I could not log into the network.

Expected results:

http://detectportal.firefox.com/success.txt should be fetched with HTTP and the login form should be sent.

Maybe it's a good idea to disallow extensions to interact with the URL used for detecting if login is required (http://detectportal.firefox.com/success.txt).

I also submitted an issue in HTTPS Everywhere:
