Title : E-mails are deleted on the POP server if an attachment is deleted or detached (creating a new copy of the message and deleting the old)

Bug : This is ugly. Deleting/detaching an attachment will delete the message internally and 
create a new one without the attachment(s), but that shouldn't lead to deletion on the 
server. Ouch.

Step to reproduce: 

The server is a POP server.
The option is "Leave a message on server" for 14 days or until they are suppressed locally
Receive from the server a mail with attachments
Locally, delete or detach attachments, but DO NOT delete the message itself

Actual results:

At the next connection to the server, the message is fully deleted from the server, while
it shouldn't

Expected results: 

The message should remain on the server. No matter it remains with its attachment, or 
without them, but the message itself shouldn't be deleted on the server since
less than 14 days from receiving
message NOT deleted locally
A candidate cause of this erroneous behavior is the fact that every time attachments 
are detached or deleted from a message, the corresponding message Id in popsate.dat is 
prefixed with a 'd' rather than the original 'k'
