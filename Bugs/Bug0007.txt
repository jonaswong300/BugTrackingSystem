New profile users lose the second character when typing into the URL bar.

Step to reproduce:
1) Create a brand spankin' new profile and start the browser
2) Select the URL bar and start typing "cbc.ca" (that's what I typed, anyways)

Actual results:
cbc.ca should show up in the URL bar

Expected results:
I got cc.ca. After the first character went in, the AwesomeBar panel started to open and do stuff, and something swallowed my second character.
