Severity Level : 2
Solved status : open
Bug : User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:80.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/80.0

Steps to reproduce:

OS: Mac Mojave

I opened firefox in safe mode, after clearing all the cache. A video starts on being clicked. However, the theater button somehow cannot be clicked, and on clicking full screen, the original sized video keeps playing and the remaining screen is black.

This does not happen on some videos, but happens on most videos. This does not happen on chrome.
