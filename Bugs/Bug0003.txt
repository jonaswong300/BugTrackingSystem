When in persistent private mode, if i use the update firefox intervention, it restarts to normal mode and not private.

Step to reproduce:
Download an older version of firefox, example a version from last week
Create a new profile and set "use the selected profile without asking at startup" on profile manager.
Launch firefox with -private from command prompt and select the new profile
open a youtube video on a a tab, and wait some minutes for firefox to download the update.
type in megabar "update firefox" and click on "restart to update"
firefox is restarted, i see in history there is no youtube.
Now go to cnn.com and then close firefox.
Launch firefox again with -private
check /view history

Actual results:
You are on persistent private mode and you see cnn.com in history

Expected results:
Cnn.com should not be in history, might be because after restart on step#5, it restarted to non-private mode.
