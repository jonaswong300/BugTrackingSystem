Malicious websites can listen for the keyup event, and perform a redirect when the user types a search term in the search bar and presses enter.
I found this issue after experiencing this weird behaviour on a website which was using the keyup listener to submit a form when enter is pressed.

Step to reproduce:
Open the POC HTML included in this report
Click on the search bar and start typing to prepare a Google search
Press enter quickly after typing the last character of the search query
See the POC HTML redirect to YouTube instead of the expected search results appearing


Actual results:
Performs a redirect when the user types a search term.

Expected results:
No redirect is supposed to occur.
