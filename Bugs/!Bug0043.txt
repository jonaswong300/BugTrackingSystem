Firefox/78.0

Steps to reproduce:
I had an account in Firefox in my pc.
This account had my login credentials in Lockwise.
I logged off from this account, created a new one with a different email and logged in 
from it at the same pc.

Actual results:
While logged in with a different account the credentials from my account were visible in 
Lockwise.
Lockwise merged the credentials of the two accounts.
Furthermore, after sync they were also available from other computers.

Expected results:
Each account should have only it's own user credentials. No merging of credentials 
should be done.
