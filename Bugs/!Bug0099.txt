Bug : User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

My Firefox version is: 57.0 (64-bit) up to date

I reduced the bug to this example. On my server is made a directory "test" with the following htaccess file:

    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /
        RewriteRule ^a\\b$ http://www.example.com/first-match [L]
        RewriteRule ^a/b$ http://www.example.com/second-match [L]
    </IfModule>

%5c = backslash encoded

The first time i typed: http://www.my-domain.com/test/a%5cb in the addressbar, Firefox sent me to: http://www.example.com/first-match
The second time i typed: http://www.my-domain.com/test/a%5cb in the addressbar, Firefox sent me to: http://www.example.com/second-match

Firefox needs to send me in both cases to http://www.example.com/first-match like for example Google Chrome is doing.


Actual results:

Firefox sent me to the wrong url.


Expected results:

Firefox should send me to the right url.
