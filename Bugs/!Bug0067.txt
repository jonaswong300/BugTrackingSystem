Keywords : design,uninstall,popup,
Reporter : user44

Solved status : open
Bug : I mentioned this in bug 702773 so perhaps this is the correct place to examine this process.

I'd like to use the same dialog used for installing: https://people.mozilla.com/~faaborg/files/projects/apps/creation-i1/permissions.html

Change the  ( Add ) button to be a ( Remove ) button.  This dialog will hopefully also give us a future way to add or remove the application from the native menu.


Step to reproduce:

1. Launch Firefox
2. Go to apps.mozillalabs.com/appdir and install an app (with or without the extension)
3. Go to myapps.mozillalabs.com
4. Click and hold down on an app and when the 'X' appears, release the mouse


Actual results:

The uninstall pop-up appears but needs an improved design.


Expected results:

An improved design of the uninstall pop-up appears.
