Firefox/69.0

Steps to reproduce:
Press Cmd-N to open a new browser window
Press Cmd-L and start typing an address immediately

Actual results:
My default start page address sometimes gets appended to the URL I was typing after 
the window finishes loading fully.
(This only happens on occasion and only if I haven't opened a window in a while, so I 
suspect there's some caching-related timing differences.)

Expected results:
Since I'd already started typing a URL, the default start page address shouldn't get appended.
