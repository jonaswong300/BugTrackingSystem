Address bar randomly collapsed when switching around the tabs. It is not consistent and can be hard to reproduce.

Step to reproduce:
Open several web page in new tabs
i.e, Tab1: about:home
Tab2: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/
Tab3: http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/nightly/
Select all url text of a Tab3
Switch tabs
Tab3 -> Tab1 -> Tab3
Switch tabs
Tab3 -> Tab2 -> Tab3

Actual results:
Step3: Selection of Address Bar is collapsed randomly.
Step4: selection of Address Bar is re-built randomly.
It is not consistent, It is very annoying.

Expected results:
Selection should not be collapsed.
It should be consistent
