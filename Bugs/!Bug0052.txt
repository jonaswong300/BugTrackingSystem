Severity Level : 3
Solved status : open
Bug : User Agent:Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

Steps to reproduce:
- Install two dictionaries.
- Go to a page with an input field.
- Enable spell checking (if not enabled yet).
- Enter a text into the input field which is known to result in a spelling error marker to 
be shown.
- Open context menu of the input field.
- Select context menu item "Languages".
- Select desired language.

Actual results:
It takes three mouse clicks (including searching on the screen, mousing to the right 
location, while paying attention to not go anywhere with the mouse where it is causing 
the the Language sub menu to close again).

This has been considered an inconvenient way to switch dictionaries (for people who 
need to write in different languages a lot) by other people and someone created this 
extension to have a GUI element that one can click on to cycle through the installed 
dictionaries:

This extensions has been commented on by 173 users, and has been attempted to be used by at least 14,260 users.
This extensions does not work anymore and/or forces Firefox' "Multiprocess Windows" 
(at "about:support") to be disabled ("0/1 (Disabled by add-ons)" in my particular case).

Expected results:
Ideally Firefox should offer these three things:
- A setting to use all installed dictionaries for spell checking (like Google Chrome does). 
(This is tricky on Linux where one has to dive into the operating system and remove some
pre-installed dictionaries files which are automatically made available in Firefox.)
- A way to select multiple dictionaries for spell checking.

- A GUI element visible in all browser windows for cycling through the installed 
dictionaries (like offered by
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dictionary-switcher/).
