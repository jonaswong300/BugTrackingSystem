Bug : User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:69.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/69.0

Step to reproduce: 

1. Open a PDF file. For example: https://people.mpi-sws.org/~dreyer/papers/iris-ground-up/paper.pdf

2. Copy-paste some text, e.g. the first sentence of the abstract of that paper.

Actual Results:  
The result is: "Irisis a framework for higher-order concurrent separation logic, which has been implemented in theCoq proof assistant and deployed very effectively in a wide variety of verification projects."
Notice the missing spaces in "Irisis" and "theCoq".

Expected Results:  
Spaces should have been copied. Copying the same text from the same PDF opened in a local PDF readers does copy spaces as expected.

This bugs makes it very annoying to copy-paste more than individual words from a PDF using Firefox' PDF viewer.
