Firefox/78.0

Steps to reproduce:
Firefox uses the “lang” attribute to detect the spell-checking language of a text area. 
This works. But if I choose a dictionary manually, the auto-detect stops working, and it
won't work again until I manually remove the pref from “content-prefs.sqlite”.
Websites where this can be annoying are e.g. multi-lingual chatrooms and translators.

Actual results:
There is no way to unset the user-selected spell-checking dictionary and go back to 
auto-detecting.

Expected results:
There should be a way to undo dictionary selection. E.g. an “Auto” option.
