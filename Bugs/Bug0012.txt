Step to reproduce:
Drag and dropping downloaded files into attacker controlled web page exposes OS username by reading 'text/uri-list' which contains full path to file which includes the OS name.
PoC attached, open and follow instructions.


Actual results:
'text/uri-list' contains OS username (assuming by default the download points to the /Downloads/ folder)


Expected results:
'text/uri-list' should be cleared from containing the full path.
