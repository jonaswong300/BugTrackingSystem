Bug : User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36


Step to reproduce:
Drag and dropping downloaded files into attacker controlled web page exposes OS username by reading 'text/uri-list' which contains full path to file which includes the OS name.
PoC attached, open and follow instructions.


Actual results:
'text/uri-list' contains OS username (assuming by default the download points to the /Downloads/ folder)


Expected results:
'text/uri-list' should be cleared from containing the full path.
