Steps to reproduce:

I opened a pdf file in firefox. Then I printed it.

On the printer output a part of the footer is missing, in the Firefox print preview it is also missing.
In Firefox pdf viewer the page is displayed correctly.

When I set scaling to 90 % in print preview I can see the footer completely.

Actual results:

A part of the footer is missing in print preview and print output.

Expected results:

At 100% scaling the page should be shown completely in print preview and should be printed completely.
