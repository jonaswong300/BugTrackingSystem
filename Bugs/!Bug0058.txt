Bug : User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; rv:23.0) Gecko/20100101 
Firefox/23.0 (Beta/Release)
Build ID: 20130730113002


Steps to reproduce:
Enabling the option to "clear the web cache on exit" doesn't actually do that , but instead 
just disables the cache altogether.

Actual Results:  
Apparently, this is done on purpose to protect Firefox from the complaints of idiots who 
would blame Firefox for hanging on exit while it clears the cache as instructed by 
the user. There is apparently also no intention to change this behavior.

Expected Results:  
If that is the case and this behavior is to be kept, then I feel it would only be correct 
to not label the option in the interface as "Options/Privacy/Clear history when Firefox 
closes/Cache" but as "Options/Privacy/Disable disk web cache".
