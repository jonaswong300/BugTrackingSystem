Does it work normally?


Step to reproduce:

1: Go to a website with a regular username/password login form. Probably works with other types of remembered info. I used https://github.com/ and https://cupcake.io. 

2: Type in the full username of a remembered account, and press enter


Actual results: 

Password fails.


Expected results: 

The password should verify and succeed.
