Step to reproduce:
Clicked on a hyperlink to download a .exe file that was requested over HTTP.

Actual results:
It offer to download it normally

Expected results:
Should display a warning when the user attempts to download a executable file (.exe, .msi, .deb, .rpm) over HTTP.

Since HTTP is not trusted and vulnerable to MITM attacks. This would encourage websites to host files over HTTPS and encourage users to beware.
