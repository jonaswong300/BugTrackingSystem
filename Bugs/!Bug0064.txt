Bug : I logged into my Yahoo account today and I could not reproduce this issue anymore. My only explanation for that is that yahoo fixed the problem with the code on their website. Maybe someone had already complained to yahoo.
By the way: After several crashes before I filed this bug report, I let Firefox report the crash through the inbuilt reporting tool. I also added a remark.


Step to reproduce:

Important: This error applies to Firefox for Linux, language German, German yahoo website, only. I am using the current Q4OS distribution with Trinity desktop. With Chrome, this error is not present.
With current Firefox on Windows 10 and Windows 7, this error is not present.
On the Yahoo website I click on mail, then enter the first part of my email address, then I click on OK.


Actual results: 

When I enter my password, Firefox often crashes. When I fully delete my password for correction, firefox also crashes, though I tried this only once.

Expected results:

I should see the yahoo mail web interface.
