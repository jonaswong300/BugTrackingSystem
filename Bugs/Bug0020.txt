Step to reproduce:
Open a PDF from an attachment in Wunderlist desktop.
In settings->applications, the way PDF is set up is:
"Portable Document Format (PDF)" -> "Preview in Firefox"

Actual results:
I've seen several results.

In every case, it first opens an ampty tab with the Wunderlist-url. Then:
1) Firefox may display dialog box asking the user what to do with the file. 

1a) Opening it with Firefox causes it to open another tab and preview the PDF there.

1b) The default action is in some cases something called "TWINUI", which opens the PDF with Edge. 
This option isn't always there, and I haven't been able to figure when and when not.

2) Firefox might download the PDF instantly, without any user interaction, to the desktop (i.e. to the default download folder).


Expected results:
The it is set in the settings to open PDF with "preview in Firefox", it should do exactly that. Always.
