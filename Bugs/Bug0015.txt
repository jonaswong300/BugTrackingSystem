Step to reproduce:
Have High contrast activated
Launch Firefox.
Start a large download.
The download is in progress.
Open the Downloads Panel (about:download).


Actual results:
The progress bar cannot be seen because it's the same colour as the background. 
I tried to do a MozRegression but went as far back as version 66 (December 2018) and it seems it's always been like this.


Expected results:
The progress bar should be in another colour.
