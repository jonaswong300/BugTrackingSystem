Bug : User Agent:  Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0

I have tested this issue on Windows 10 x64 with the latest Firefox release (50.1.0) and the 
latest Nightly (53.0a1-20170110075905) and managed to reproduce it.
When testing the specified page from step 1 in the description, when zooming and 
"stepping", the page is significantly slower in Firefox than in Chrome.


Step to reproduce: 

1. Go to the map of Google Flights, e.g. https://www.google.de/flights/#search;f=TXL,SXF,QPP,BER;t=ORK;d=2017-08-19;r=2017-08-25;mc=m
2. a) Zoom in with Mouse Wheel (very slow). Also the "Stepping" is not as nice as in Chrome here: Mousewheel and then you zoom in/out far too much.
2. b) Or Pan the Map (slow)
3. Do the same in Chrome (both fast)

Actual results: 

Google Flights is barely usable due to this slowness /sluggishness (eventually I 
switched to Chrome for booking a flight)

Expected results: 

Should be as fast as Chrome.
