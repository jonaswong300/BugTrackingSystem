Bug : User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0
Build ID: 20150511122605

Step to reproduce:
Paste http://bugs.ghostscript.com/show_bug.cgi?id=694852 in the address bar. Note: 
the machine bugs.ghostscript.com currently doesn't answer to ping; in the future, this
 URL should be changed to one with a similar problem.

Actual results:
After some time, the page loading stops. "View Page Info" says about:newtab (with the 
default profile, but it can also be about:blank if one has changed new tab configuration
to that), and the page is not reloadable (to retry the connection). When Firefox is 
restarted, the tab is missing.

Expected results:
One should get a "Problem loading page" error message with a "Try again" button and the 
right URL in "View Page Info", like when the server is not found, e.g. http://foo.bar.invalid/
