Build ID: 20161023004025



Step to reproduce:
I use firefox to default preview my images.
I recently switched to firefox developer, but I'm unable to associate .jpg with firefox devloper. It keeps opening the file in the default firefox.
I associated the .jpg to firefox developer trough the properties menu of the jpg file, and selected the firefox developer executable to open jpg.
But it still keeps the association with the default firefox.

In the windows settings (file association), I don't have the choice to select firefox developers at all.


Actual results:
No matter what i do it keeps the file association to the default firefox




Expected results:
File association, should change to firefox developers
