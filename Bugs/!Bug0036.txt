 Firefox/81.0

Steps to reproduce:
1: open https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox in a tab.
2: open another, new tab to a different page, like the google frontpage.
3: type wiki firefox into the address bar and down arrow to the "switch to tab" result for
 the tab in step 1.
4: press alt+enter

Actual results:
it didn't switch to the wiki firefox tab, instead it loaded the wiki firefox page in the currently 
active tab, which goes contrary to the usual behavior for alt-enter in the address bar.

Expected results:
It should have switched to the tab
