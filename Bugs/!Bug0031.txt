Bug : User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:41.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/41.0
Build ID: 20150511122605

Step to reproduce:
- In Awesomebar type the word 'toe' or any other one word string (no spaces)
- hit enter


Actual results:
I see a notification (see attachment) asking me if i want to go to 'toe', clicking yes
takes me to my ISP's search UI and I can no longer search for toe through the awesomebar 
without being redirected.

Expected results:
I see a search results page with no notification.
