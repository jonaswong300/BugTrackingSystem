Bug : FWIW, this bug still happens with the web site I initially reported. Both my Windows version and Firefox version have changed in the meantime: I am now on Win10 Pro with Firefox 64.0.2.
However, when I was required a few minutes ago to create a new password for Bugzilla I use an @ in the new password ... and so far do not see this bug when logging out and then back into Bugzilla.

Step to reproduce:
 
1.)  Steps:
enter a new password on the web site
username = my_email_address@gmail.com
password = Alpha@Beta_Delta
2.)  Firefox asks if I want to save this login information:
username = Alpha@Beta_Delta
password = Alpha@Beta_Delta
3.)  Manually corrected the username information by typing it in FireFox's little remember this logon dialog box.
4.)  Next time I go to the Cochlear store Firefox correctly auto-fills my username and password ... but because my password contains the @ character  Firefox prompts my to save my "changed" logon information with my password AGAIN displayed in the username field.


Actual results: 

Mozilla continues to think my password is my username.


Expected results:

 Mozilla should have paid attention to the labels on the login form - UserName and Password - to determine which field is the username and which is the password.   The presence of the @ character in my password should have played no role whatsoever.

And by displaying my password in plain text in the username field Mozilla is also showing it to anyone who happens to be looking over my shoulder.
