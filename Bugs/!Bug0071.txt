Title : Support key wrap/unwrap with RSA-OAEP
Keywords : support,key,wrap,unwrap,RSA-OAEP,

Severity Level : 3
Solved status : open
Bug : User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Fedora; Linux x86_64; rv:80.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/80.0
Step to reproduce:
Attempted to use PK11_PubWrapSymKey with type = CKM_RSA_PKCS_OAEP.
Also failed to use PK11_PubUnwrapSymKey with OAEP as this lacks a way to indicate mechanism type.
Actual results:
When attempting to use PK11_PubWrapSymKey with type = CKM_RSA_PKCS_OAEP, PK11_PubWrapSymKey succeeds but silently (!) switches to the CKM_RSA_PKCS mechanism. Partly this is because PK11_PubWrapSymKey lacks a way to specify mechanism parameters. PK11_PubUnwrapSymKey behaves similarly, but it also lacks a way to specify the exact mechanism (again, defaulting to CKM_RSA_PKCS).
Expected results:
In consultation with Bob Relyea, I'm proposing three patches:
Causes PK11_PubWrapSymKey to return an error when type != CKM_RSA_PKCS and a RSA key is passed in.
Introduces PK11_PubWrapSymKeyWithMechanism, which also accepts a mechanism parameter value to pass down into C_Wrap.
Introduces PK11_PubUnwrapSymKeyWithMechanism, which also accepts a type and a mechanism parameter value to pass down into C_Unwrap.
