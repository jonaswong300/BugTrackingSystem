Steps to reproduce:
1. Start Firefox.
2. Drag Firefox window to the bottom of the screen.
3. Click the "Library" button.
4. Click the "Bookmarks" option.


Actual results:
The bookmarks panel is displayed on top of the Firefox window for a very short 
period of time (even if there is the necessary available space to be displayed at the bottom) and then corrects itself.

Expected results:
The bookmarks panel is displayed on the bottom side of Firefox window (If it has the 
necessary space available).
