Bug : User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 
(KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/75.0.3770.142 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:
While the Firefox browser is open (private account), I wanted to launch a seperate 
Firefox window with a different Firefox account (work account) as is possible with Chrome.

Actual results:
Not currently possible.

Expected results:
Clicking on the Firefox account user icon in the top left of the browser window it should be 
possible to switch and choose a different Firefox account user to open a new window 
with. I would expect a similar experience as is currently possible with Chrome.
