% text” does not find text when switching from container to container, when it should.

Step to reproduce:
Open a fresh Firefox, with a fresh profile
Install the multi-container addon. https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/ (Keep the tab open on that amo url)
Open a new tab
In the address bar, type "% addon". It will show the url above (and about:addons if like me you ended up there from about:addons)
Now open a tab in a new container, and open some page in it, say, Wikipedia.
In the address bar, type "% addon". It will show nothing, and AIUI, that's expected.
Now open a new tab, which will open in the original container. In the address bar, type "% addon". It will show nothing, which it should show the same as the first time.


Actual results:
“% text” does not show anything in the original container.

Expected results:
“% text” should show results in the original container.
