When I double click to select a file from the file upload dialog, if there is a clickable entity in the web page behind the dialog, it will autofill the file upload field and close the file upload dialog, but also clicks the entity behind!

Reproducible: Always

Step to reproduce: 

1. Open up file upload dialog
2. Move it so that the icon of the file you wish to click is directly over a clickable entity on the web page
3. Double-click

Actual Results:  
Navigates away


Expected Results:  
Just filled in my file field
