Step to reproduce:
 A web page can make an invisible video follow the mouse cursor, causing a video to pop up in picture-in-picture mode if the user clicks anywhere on the page. This could be used by spammy websites to create autoplaying video popup ads.

Actual results:
 The PiP flyout on an invisible video can be unintentionally clicked by a user.
Expected results: 
Either make the PiP flyout always visible, regardless of video opacity. Or prevent the PiP flyout displaying if the video is not visible.
