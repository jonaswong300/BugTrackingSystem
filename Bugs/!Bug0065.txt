Severity Level : 1
Solved status : open
Bug : I tested this issue on Mac OS X 10.13 with FF 63 release and I updated it to FF 63.0.1 
release after which I reset my FF account password but I can't reproduce this issue. 
Did you update it from 62 to 63.0.1 version?

Step to reproduce:

I did an update of firefox and reset the firefox account password


Actual results: 

Firefox lost all saved logins, passwords, bookmarks


Expected results: 

It should have brought me back my saved logins, passwords, and bookmarks
