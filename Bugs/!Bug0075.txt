Severity Level : 1
Solved status : open
Bug : User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0 SeaMonkey/2.53.1 Lightning/5.8.1
Step to reproduce:
In SeaMonkey latest version 2.53.1, I create 5 profiles and in each profile my main setting is to set:
"Always clear private data when I close Seamonkey"
with more options that it will erase all of 9 checked items (from "Browsing History", to "Authenticated Session", see menu Preferences>Privacy & Security>Private Data).
I browse some sites, say using profile1, and when I close it, a form called "Clear Private Data" is displayed that warns me before everything is deleted; and I hit the 'Clear Private Data Now' button.
Then I open a browser again with the same profile (profile1). A bug is, all of the links since last used, are still remembered.
This issue did not happen in SeaMonkey version 2.49.5, but now happened in the latest version.
Wanted to let you know that I also found this issue for all versions (from version 38 to now on) of firefox browser, that is why I no longer interested with firefox and I don't want this issue to happen to seamonkey.
PS: I'm a thunderbird and seamonkey lover and currently always make a donation. But now thunderbird stop all donation, please also fix it because I'll glad to make donation
 
Actual results:
Cookies/History not removed in a Seamonkey (or FireFox) profile
Expected results: 
I want Cookies/History is completely removed in a Seamonkey (or FireFox) profile
