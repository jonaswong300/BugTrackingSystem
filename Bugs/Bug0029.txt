Bug : Firefox 66.0b5, Windows 10.0.17134.523, American Airlines 
WiFi (ViaSat, 5.5 Mbps, 597ms latency)


Step to reproduce:
Type (e.g., foo) in AwesomeBar



Actual results:
History and current tab results show instantly. Search suggestions take > 1s to 
load and cause a five result row jank when the load. The jank may result in users 
clicking on the incorrect search results


Expected results:
No jank. Approaches like content placeholders or changes in ordering
 (i.e. search results below history results) would be preferable
