Keywords : form,autocomplete,

Severity Level : 1
Solved status : open
Bug : User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:54.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/54.0
Build ID: 20170628075643

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open 1st page with form (e.g. login form for email);
2. When 1st page is still loading, immediately open new tab and some other page in it;
3. After a while return to 1st page and start typing data into form fields (e.g. email address);


Actual results:

When I start typing, sometimes FF does not show dropdown list below input field with previously entered values which match entered text. This occurs only sometimes, other times it works as expected.


Expected results:

FF should show dropdown list below input field with previously entered value(s).

This is old bug, I recall that for the first time I encountered it few years ago.
