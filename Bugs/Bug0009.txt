Step to reproduce:
When I enter abc/def to address bar and press enter, it's searching on google - which is the way I need. If I drag & drop the same text to the address bar it's going to abc.de/def which is completely wrong

Actual results:
Firefox is looking for domain instead of searching

Expected results:
the same as pressing enter on address bar -> searching on google.
