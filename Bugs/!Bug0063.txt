Bug : This is my first submitted bug here so excuse me if I'm wrong. I think it's not an enhancement request because it doesn't work as it's supposed to. If the password query isn't a popup the problem doesn't occur and in my opinion, the password query of a popup and a "normal site" like for example Gmail should work the same. But they don't.


Step to reproduce:

1. Save two passwords on the same site where the query is a popup.
2. Open the query and you won't be able to get the second password entered.


Actual results: 

no way of saving the credentials


Expected results:

 Give a menu to choose which pair of username and password should be used.
