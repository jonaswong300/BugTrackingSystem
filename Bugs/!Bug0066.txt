Title : Make it easy for a person without a password to get a password reset link

Bug : What is actually needed here is the ability to re-authenticate to GitHub and change the email to another one associated with the same account.
Pending some auth re-architecture, this will be possible.

As a stop-gap, you can perform a password reset and then use the password to change the email address. 

I'll leave this bug open until we can change Github auth backed accounts without setting a password on them.


Step to reproduce: 

Attempt to change the email address


Actual results: 

Cannot change email as I have no password do to Github login


Expected results:

Remove requirement for passwords on Github accounts
