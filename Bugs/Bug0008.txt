Step to reproduce:
Scrolled the address bar to the end of a long URL.

Actual results:
The end of the URL was faded away, even though the whole of the URL was within view. This suggested there was more URL to show (there wasn't).

Expected results:
The end of the URL should be shown without a fade effect, to aid readability and to make it clear that there is no more URL hidden to the right.
Actual results:
The end of the URL was faded away, even though the whole of the URL was within view. This suggested there was more URL to show (there wasn't).
