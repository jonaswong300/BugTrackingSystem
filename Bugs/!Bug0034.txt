Step to reproduce:
Start typing some URL in the URL field

Actual results:
Below the URL/address field it appears a list of hints/suggestions. The font & 
size there are noticeably bigger than in the address field. 

Expected results:
The suggestions should have the same font or smaller than the one in the URL field.

..as the hints are subitems (one of the suggestions) and also they are very long so the 
small font size makes sense.
