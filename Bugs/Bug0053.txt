Steps to reproduce:
1. Run GNOME in Linux
2. Open Firefox
3. Click on any button in the toolbar that presents a drop-down menu.  
This includes many plugin menus like Bitwarden and LastPass, or even the standard "hamburger" menu or bookmarks.
4. Attempt to fill out a form in said drop down
5. Attempt to switch language support by hitting `Super+Space`.


Actual results:
Your keyboard layout is changed and the drop-down window closes.

Expected results:
Your keyboard layout is changed and the drop-down window remains open so 
you can finish filing out the form with the new keyboard layout.
