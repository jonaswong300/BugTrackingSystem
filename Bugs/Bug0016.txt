Bug : Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36

Step to reproduce:
Host the attached PoC as well as a simple redirector then follow steps within PoC.
redir.php:
<? header("Location: https://www.facebook.com/me"); ?>

Actual results:
When we drag and drop an anchor tag pointing to a file that 30x redirects towards facebook.com the download manager will show 
the wrong origin. 
It shows that the source of the download is from localhost even though the entire contents of the file downloaded is from 
facebook.com. 

Coupling this with the fact that anything drag and dropped from the downloads manager into web page allows us to read full 
content victim facebook page.


Expected results:
If the download manager attempts to download a file that contains a header pointing to a new (cross origin) location 
then this new location should be the source displayed to prevent confusion. 
Which is what chromes download manager does.
