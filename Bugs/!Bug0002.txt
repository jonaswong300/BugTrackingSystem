Awesomebar is doing auto-complete of “about:blank” to “about:blank/”. This causes the user to be directed to an error page instead of a blank page.

Step to reproduce:
Step 1: Open a blank page
Step 2: Type in “about:blank” and press enter

Actual results:
Auto-complete adds an additional “/” at the back of the URL, causing an error page.

Expected results:
Auto-complete should not add the additional “/”.
