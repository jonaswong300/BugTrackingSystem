Bug : User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0
Build ID: 20170302120751

Step to reproduce:
On macOS with FF 52, enter a URL with a backslash into the location bar. 
I'm entering a JSON query in the location bar and need to escape some curly braces (escaped with a backslash, and that backslash needs a backslash escape as well), so I enter a URL like this into my browser:
https://example.com/query/{"field": "\\{value\\}"}/

Actual results:
Firefox replaces the backslashes with slashes, destroying the query, and requesting the following path:
/query/%7B%22field%22:%20%22//%7Bvalue//%7D%22%7D/
aka
/query/{"field": "//{value//}"}/
This path contains six parts rather than the intended two.

Expected results:
Firefox should instead request a path as entered by a user like so:
/query/%7B%22field%22:%20%22%5C%5C%7Bvalue%5C%5C%7D%22%7D/
If one instead enters into the location bar the quoted %5C character for the backslashes, the query is transmitted as expected and the browser renders a literal backslash in the location bar. 
However, because these backslashes are now literals, if one re-submits that location, the literal backslashes are converted to forward slashes.
