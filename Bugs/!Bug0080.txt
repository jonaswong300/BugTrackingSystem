Opening website https://www.diepresse.com/5711204/syrien-russland-will-friedlichen-kurden-sicherheit-garantieren and trying to print

same is for Firefox on Android, using an extension "Printable â€“ The Print Doctor" fixes the issue, but I can't expect all people in my company to install add ons, with Chrome it works
